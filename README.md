## Why this project exists?

My best friend does daily trades on Rocket League and he was tracking them on a paper... Not all serious, we came up with this idea. And after some days the first prototype was ready to use!(Which is this one.)

## Current Bugs
--> When a number smaller than 10 put in Buy, instead of a minues value, the outcome is positive. 

## Future plans 
-> Make website responsive. (Right now unusable for mobile and not all so great exp on higher res) <br/>
-> Add an auth system and let everyone get their own database. (Right now only my friend can use this because the database is shared). <br/>
-> Add data visuliation -using d3js?- that shows monthly or weekly profits. <br/>
